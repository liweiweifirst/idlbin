; NAME:
;       NCDF_BROWSER
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       This program is designed to make it easier to browse and read the 
;       data and metadata in netCDF and HDF files. The user can browse files, 
;       and read the data and metadata into main-level IDL variables. New netCDF 
;       and HDF files can be opened at any time. The user interacts with the 
;       program via a browser window (GUI). This program is a wrapper for the
;       NCDF_DATA object (ncdf_data__define.pro), which must also be downloaded.
;       
;       Note that only HDF files with scientific datasets (SD) can be read currently.
;       There is no support for VDATA objects or other objects sometimes found in HDF
;       files. Also note that when variables are returned from HDF files, they are returned
;       in a calibrated form, if calibration information about the variable is present in the
;       file. Calibration information is presented as an extra variable attribute in the
;       browser.
;     
;          calibratedData = calData.cal * (uncalibratedData - calData.offset)

; CATEGORY:

;       File I/O
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       IDL> NCDF_Browser, filename
;
; Arguments:
;
;       filename: The name of a netCDF and HDF file to open and browse.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;       
;       EXTENSION: In general, netCDF and HDF files use *.nc, *.ncf, *.ncdf and *.hdf file extensions to
;                  identify themselves as netCDF and HDF files. Some users have their own file extensions.
;                  You can use this keyword to identify the file extension you wish to use. If
;                  set here, it will be used as the file filter in place of the normal file 
;                  extensions in DIALOG_PICKFILE.
;
;                      obj = ('NCDF_DATA', file, EXTENSION='*.bin')
;
;       NO_READ_ON_PARSE: Normally, when a file is opened it is parsed for information.
;                  One piece of information is the minimum and maximum values of the variables.
;                  This requires actually reading the variables. This can slow things down 
;                  considerably is the variable is large. Setting this keyword will suppress 
;                  the reading of the variables during the parsing of the data file, with the
;                  result that no minimum or maximum values will be reported.
;
; NOTES:
;       
;       This program is only a (useful) front-end for a more flexible
;       object program of class NCDF_DATA. In this front end, the NCDF_DATA
;       object is created and then destroyed when the GUI is destroyed.
;       The NCDF_DATA object can be used to read netCDF data in a non-interactive
;       way, if you prefer not to use a GUI to interact with the data file.
;
; REQUIRES:
;
;        The following programs are required from the Coyote Library.

; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       Written by:  David W. Fanning, 03 Feb 2008. Used ideas from many
;           people, including Chris Torrence, Ken Bowman, Liam Gumely, 
;           Andrew Slater, and Paul van Delst.
;       Added Extension keyword. DWF. 04 Feb 2008.
;       Added error handling and protection for NCDF variables that have a dimension of length zero. 22 April 2009. DWF.
;       Added NO_READ_ON_PARSE keyword. 22 April 2009. DWF.
;       Now convert NCDF CHAR type variables to strings on output. 22 April 2009. DWF
