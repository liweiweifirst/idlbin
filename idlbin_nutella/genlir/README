Contains an IDL routine which uses the recipe of Chary & ELbaz (2001) to calculate
bolometric luminosities from 24 micron flux densities and redshift. It
does the following:
1.  takes the CE01 and Dale & Helou (2002) templates 
2.  redshifts all the templates it to the given redshift 
3.  finds the template which reproduces the observed 24 micron flux most closely
4.  selects that template and renormalizes it to the observed 24 micron flux
5.  uses the template to give LIR after applying the correct normalization factor

The returned LIR is the average of the estimates from CE01 and DH02. The systematic
error is the difference between those two estimates of LIR. While the statistical
error is simply due to the flux density error. flux density and error are in microJy,
LIR and LIRerr are in Lsun.

Caveats: 

1. The DH02 templates are not luminosity-dependent templates and have been converted
to that form by Ranga-Ram Chary. 

2. The LIR estimate is STRONGLY reliant on the assumption that the LMIR-LFIR relation
seen in the local Universe is valid at higher redshifts. There is quite some evidence
that PAH strengths seem to be stronger at high redshift at large LIR values, compared 
to the CE01 templates (e.g. Pope et al. 2007 work on SMGs). Future work will try to fold 
in these spectral results into the templates.
