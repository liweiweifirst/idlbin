ACCESSING THE CDAC USING MODEMS
.Help

The CDAC has 6 incoming modem lines supporting 2400-baud
communications and 2 supporting 9600-baud.  These connections
are accessible by any user with a terminal modem or a
personal computer with a terminal emulator and modem, to access
the CDAC VMS cluster, the GI VMS node, or the ULTRIX nodes.

The phone number for the 2400-baud modems is (301) 513-7713 and for
the 9600-baud modems is (301) 513-7721.  The system should
automatically access one of the available incoming lines for that
speed.  In the event that there is a problem with the primary numbers,
users can try dialing into the other lines directly: -7714 through
-7718 for 2400, -7722 for 9600.  The standard terminal settings for
access are: 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.  The user's terminal
emulator must support VMS-compatible emulation (either VT or
Tektronics).

Following modem connection, the user will be connected to a
terminal server with prompt LOCAL> and can proceed with 
C COBECL or C ZWICKY or C CUBA, then the username and
password at the machine login prompts.  Limited help is
available at LOCAL> prompt by typing ? . 

If the user encounters a problem with a modem, noise, or line
drop-outs, he or she should type SHOW PORT right after the connection
is made, note the number, and report this number with a description of
the problem by electronic mail to COBECL::HARZER and COBECL::GAVIGAN.
To report problems by phone contact (301)513-7743 (Harzer) or the
systems management beeper (202)896-6932.
