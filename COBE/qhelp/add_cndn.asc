{BT}I. INTRODUCTION{N}

This directory contains the Greenbank 1400 MHz sky maps covering the 
declination band -5 deg to +82 deg as machine readable FITS-format 
images (Wells, Greisen, and Harten 1981, Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. 44, 
363).


{BT}II. THE GREENBANK 1400 MHz SKY MAPS {N}
    {BT}COVERING -5 DEG TO +82 DEG DECLINATION{N}

The Greenbank 300-foot (91 m) transit telescope and four-feed
receiver were used to make a 1400 MHz continuum survey of the -5 deg 
to +82 deg declination band, covering the right-ascension range
7h 30m to 19h 30m during 1983 April 2-21 (Condon and Broderick 1985,
Astron. J. 90, 2540) and 19h 30m to 7h 30m during 1983 October 5--26 
(Condon and Broderick 1986, Astron. J. 91, 1051).  Running-median 
baselines 100 arcmin long were subtracted from the 10 deg/min
total-power elevation scans (nearly declination scans) to eliminate 
baseline drifts caused by receiver gain changes, atmospheric emission, 
and spillover.  This baseline subtraction partially suppresses smooth
radio sources extending more than about 1 deg in declination.  It
also produces short negative strips on the uphill side of sources
on background gradients; these look like shadows on gray-scale
displays of the maps.

After baseline subtraction, editing, and calibration, the scan data 
were mapped with the AIPS task GRIDR.  The survey area was divided 
into 144 square total-intensity images, each 512 pixels * 2 arcmin/pixel
~17 deg on a side, centered on all combinations of r.a. = 0h, 1h,...,
23h and dec. = 0 deg, +15 deg,..., +75 deg (equinox B1950).  These 
maps are stored in this directory, one map per file.  Each
file name specifies the map center right ascension and declination: 
23H45D is the map centered on r.a. = 23 hours , dec. = +45 deg.

The point-source response is nearly Gaussian with FWHM major axis
~12.7 arcmin, minor axis ~11.1 arcmin, and major-axis P.A. = 0 deg.
The maps are confusion limited with rms confusion plus noise 25-30 mJy 
except near the galactic plane, so that individual point sources 
stronger than about 150 mJy should be reliable.  Fainter "sources" 
are usually "real" in the sense that they would appear in any 
noiseless map of the sky made with the same resolution, but they are
often unresolved blends of two or more physically unrelated radio 
sources.  Statistical properties of source samples with average flux
densities much less than 150 mJy can sometimes be derived from these
maps (cf. Condon and Broderick 1986, Astron. J., 92, 94).

To read a map into AIPS, copy the map file into the AIPS directory
called /fits, naming the file using no lower-case letters.  For
example, if you are in the AIPS /fits directory, type:
% cp /cdrom/FIT1400/23H45D 23H45D
Then start up AIPS and load this file with the task IMLOD, specifying
INFILE = '23H45D' and OUTNAME ''.

Individual source positions and flux densities may be extracted from 
the maps by Gaussian fitting (e.g., using the AIPS task IMFIT).
The rms uncertainty in the fitted peak flux density S of a point source 
is the quadratic sum of 25-30 mJy and 0.05S.  The rms uncertainty
in the fitted right ascension of a point source is the quadratic sum
of the 17 arcsec pointing error and a noise-plus-confusion term
25-30 mJy * 11.1 arcmin / (2S).  The rms declination uncertainty is
the quadratic sum of 23 arcsec and 25-30 mJy * 12.7 arcmin / (2S).

The 1400 MHz flux densities of any sample of objects (bright galaxies, 
infrared sources, etc.) with known positions may be obtained 
automatically from the maps by procedures written in the AIPS command 
language, POPS (Condon and Broderick 1986).  Such procedures can 
easily be modified to perform additional tasks, such as determining 
radio positions and making contour plots if the 1400 MHz flux 
densities exceed a preset threshold.  Groups of procedures are most
conveniently stored as RUN files in AIPS.  One very useful RUN file
can make RAdio IDentifications on the 1400 MHz maps.  It is called
RAID1400.RUN and appears in the PROGS directory of the Greenbank CD-ROM.  
It contains the procedure RAID whose arguments are the B1950 
coordinates of the object to be identified.  Repeated calls to RAID
allow the user to determine the 1400 MHz flux densities and positions
of radio sources on or near the positions of all objects in a list.
The calls to RAID can themselves be placed in a run file, so that
radio identifications of very large numbers of objects can be made 
with little human intervention.  For example, of the ~12,000 UGC 
galaxies with declinations < +82 deg, those containing radio source 
stronger than 150 mJy at 1400 MHz were found with the aid of RAID run 
files (Condon and Broderick 1988, Astron. J., 96, 30).  For more
information on AIPS RUN files and on using RAID to do "armchair radio 
astronomy," see the AIPS Cookbook and the comments in the file 
RAID1400.RUN.
