{BT}I. INTRODUCTION{N}

This CD-ROM contains the Greenbank 1400 MHz sky maps covering the 
declination band -5 deg to +82 deg, the Greenbank 4.85 GHz sky maps
covering 0 deg to +75 deg, and the 87GB catalog of radio sources 
covering 0 deg to +75 deg at 4.85 GHz as machine readable FITS-format 
images (Wells, Greisen, and Harten 1981, Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. 44, 
363) and extension tables (Harten et al. 1988, Astron. Astrophys. Suppl.
73, 365).  A standard text version of the 87GB source catalog is
also included.  They may be found in the three directories FIT1400, 
FIT4850, and 87GB, respectively.  There is a fourth directory
called PROGS that contains several useful computer programs. 
However, most map analysis will require additional software (such as
AIPS or IRAF) capable of reading FITS images and manipulating them.


{BT}II. THE GREENBANK 1400 MHz SKY MAPS {N}
    {BT}COVERING -5 DEG TO +82 DEG DECLINATION{N}

The Greenbank 300-foot (91 m) transit telescope and four-feed
receiver were used to make a 1400 MHz continuum survey of the -5 deg 
to +82 deg declination band, covering the right-ascension range
7h 30m to 19h 30m during 1983 April 2-21 (Condon and Broderick 1985,
Astron. J. 90, 2540) and 19h 30m to 7h 30m during 1983 October 5--26 
(Condon and Broderick 1986, Astron. J. 91, 1051).  Running-median 
baselines 100 arcmin long were subtracted from the 10 deg/min
total-power elevation scans (nearly declination scans) to eliminate 
baseline drifts caused by receiver gain changes, atmospheric emission, 
and spillover.  This baseline subtraction partially suppresses smooth
radio sources extending more than about 1 deg in declination.  It
also produces short negative strips on the uphill side of sources
on background gradients; these look like shadows on gray-scale
displays of the maps.

After baseline subtraction, editing, and calibration, the scan data 
were mapped with the AIPS task GRIDR.  The survey area was divided 
into 144 square total-intensity images, each 512 pixels * 2 arcmin/pixel
~17 deg on a side, centered on all combinations of r.a. = 0h, 1h,...,
23h and dec. = 0 deg, +15 deg,..., +75 deg (equinox B1950).  These 
maps are stored in the directory FIT1400, one map per file.  Each
file name specifies the map center right ascension and declination: 
23H45D is the map centered on r.a. = 23 hours , dec. = +45 deg.

The point-source response is nearly Gaussian with FWHM major axis
~12.7 arcmin, minor axis ~11.1 arcmin, and major-axis P.A. = 0 deg.
The maps are confusion limited with rms confusion plus noise 25-30 mJy 
except near the galactic plane, so that individual point sources 
stronger than about 150 mJy should be reliable.  Fainter "sources" 
are usually "real" in the sense that they would appear in any 
noiseless map of the sky made with the same resolution, but they are
often unresolved blends of two or more physically unrelated radio 
sources.  Statistical properties of source samples with average flux
densities much less than 150 mJy can sometimes be derived from these
maps (cf. Condon and Broderick 1986, Astron. J., 92, 94).

To read a map into AIPS, copy the map file into the AIPS directory
called /fits, naming the file using no lower-case letters.  For
example, if you are in the AIPS /fits directory, type:
% cp /cdrom/FIT1400/23H45D 23H45D
Then start up AIPS and load this file with the task IMLOD, specifying
INFILE = '23H45D' and OUTNAME ''.

Individual source positions and flux densities may be extracted from 
the maps by Gaussian fitting (e.g., using the AIPS task IMFIT).
The rms uncertainty in the fitted peak flux density S of a point source 
is the quadratic sum of 25-30 mJy and 0.05S.  The rms uncertainty
in the fitted right ascension of a point source is the quadratic sum
of the 17 arcsec pointing error and a noise-plus-confusion term
25-30 mJy * 11.1 arcmin / (2S).  The rms declination uncertainty is
the quadratic sum of 23 arcsec and 25-30 mJy * 12.7 arcmin / (2S).

The 1400 MHz flux densities of any sample of objects (bright galaxies, 
infrared sources, etc.) with known positions may be obtained 
automatically from the maps by procedures written in the AIPS command 
language, POPS (Condon and Broderick 1986).  Such procedures can 
easily be modified to perform additional tasks, such as determining 
radio positions and making contour plots if the 1400 MHz flux 
densities exceed a preset threshold.  Groups of procedures are most
conveniently stored as RUN files in AIPS.  One very useful RUN file
can make RAdio IDentifications on the 1400 MHz maps.  It is called
RAID1400.RUN and appears in the PROGS directory of this CD-ROM.  
It contains the procedure RAID whose arguments are the B1950 
coordinates of the object to be identified.  Repeated calls to RAID
allow the user to determine the 1400 MHz flux densities and positions
of radio sources on or near the positions of all objects in a list.
The calls to RAID can themselves be placed in a run file, so that
radio identifications of very large numbers of objects can be made 
with little human intervention.  For example, of the ~12,000 UGC 
galaxies with declinations < +82 deg, those containing radio source 
stronger than 150 mJy at 1400 MHz were found with the aid of RAID run 
files (Condon and Broderick 1988, Astron. J., 96, 30).  For more
information on AIPS RUN files and on using RAID to do "armchair radio 
astronomy," see the AIPS Cookbook and the comments in the file 
RAID1400.RUN.
 

{BT}III. THE GREENBANK 4.85 GHz SKY MAPS {N}
     {BT}COVERING 0 DEG TO +75 DEG DECLINATION{N}

The  7 beam * 2 polarization = 14 channel receiver was used on the 
Greenbank 300-foot (91 m) transit telescope during 1987 October to 
make a total-power survey of the declination band 0 deg to +75 deg at
4.85 GHz (Condon, Broderick, and Seielstad 1989, Astron. J. 97, 1064).  
Smooth sources extended more than about 20 arcmin in declination are 
parially suppressed by the 40-arcmin running-median baselines 
subtracted from the 10 deg/min elevation (~ declination) scans.  
The data were reduced with AIPS to yield 285 total-intensity 
maps covering 6.0 sr with ~3.7 arcmin by ~3.3 arcmin FWHM resolution. 
The sky maps are squares 1024 pixels * 40 arcsec/pixel ~ 11.4 deg 
on a side.  Their centers are all 288 combinations of the 36 
right ascensions r.a. =  00h 20m, 01h 00m, 01h 40m,..., 23h 40m 
and the eight declinations dec. = 0 deg, +10 deg,..., +70 deg 
except for the three maps covering 
12h 40m < r.a. < 14h 40m, 0 deg < dec. < +5 deg (a total of 0.05 sr), 
which were rejected because of strong solar interference.  
The 285 FITS-format map files are located in the directory FIT4850.
A sample map file name is A0020D10, where the four digits following
the letter A are the hours and minutes of right ascension and
the two digits following the letter D are the degrees of declination
at the map center.

The 4.85 GHz maps are noise limited with average rms noise plus 
confusion ~5 mJy, increasing to ~8 mJy near the celestial equator.  
The point-source response is approximately Gaussian, but telescope 
pointing errors, differences between the sizes and shapes of the seven 
beams, and nonuniform sampling cause the map point-source response to 
be slightly more irregular than expected from noise alone.  Radiation 
scattered from the feed-support legs produces east-west sidelobes with 
up to 1% amplitude.

These maps can also be analyzed in AIPS.  To read a map into AIPS,
copy the map file to the AIPS /fits directory.  Name the file without
using lower-case letters; e.g., A0020D10.  Then start up AIPS
and copy the file from the /fits area using the AIPS task IMLOD,
specifying INFILE = 'A0020D10' and OUTNAME ''.  AIPS will rename
this map as '0020+10/87', the form used by the procedure RAID in the
RUN file RAID4850.RUN described below.  Procedures written in the AIPS 
command language POPS can be used to find objects automatically, 
determine their 4.85 GHz flux densities, etc.  (See the discussion
of AIPS prodecures and RUN files in the last paragraph of Sec. II)
The file RAID4850.RUN in the directory PROGS of this CD-ROM 
contains the procedures needed to make RAdio IDentifications from the 
4.85 GHz maps.  The 4.85 GHz and 1400 MHz maps can be used together 
to measure radio spectral indices.  

The rms uncertainty in the fitted peak flux density S of a point
source is the quadratic sum of the rms noise and 0.12S. The faintest 
reliable sources are about 5 times the rms noise plus confusion,
or 25-40 mJy depending on declination.  The effect of noise on the
running median baseline causes the fitted flux densities to be
biased low by about 2 mJy.  The rms uncertainties in the
fitted right ascension and declination of a point source are the
quadratic sums of pointing errors and noise terms.  They vary
with both right ascension and declination (see the booklet enclosed
with this CD-ROM or Astron. J. 97, 1064).  The pointing error term
is typically about 10 arcsec.  The noise term is inversely proportional
to the flux-density S, reaching 10 arcsec at S ~ 50 mJy and 20 
arcsec for the faintest reliable sources.  For a detailed discussion
of source fitting on the 4.85 GHz maps, see Gregory and Condon 1991,
Astrophys. J. Suppl, 77, 1.


{BT}IV. THE 87GB CATALOG OF RADIO SOURCES COVERING 0 DEG TO +75 DEG {N}
    {BT}DECLINATION AT 4.85 GHz{N}

The Greenbank 300-foot (91 m) telescope was used during 1987 October
to map 6.0 sr of sky in the 0 deg to +75 deg declination band at 4.85 
GHz (Sec. III).  The 87GB catalog of 54,579 discrete sources with 
angular sizes < 10.5 arcmin and flux densities larger than S ~ 25-40 mJy
was derived from these maps (Gregory and Condon 1991, Astrophys. J.
Suppl., 77, 1).  The catalog positions and peak flux densities have 
been corrected for known map biases.  Their estimated rms uncertainties 
were verified by comparisons with more accurate positions and flux 
densities available for some sources.

The printed version of this catalog lists the sources' positions
(equinox B1950), peak flux densities, and their rms uncertainties.  
Flags `C', `E', and `W' denote confusion, significant source extension,
and warning, respectively.  Copies can be obtained from:

Four machine-readable versions are in the directory 87GB of this CD-ROM
in subdirectories FITB1950, FITJ2000, TXTB1950, and TXTJ2000.
The last five characters, B1950 or J2000, refer to the equinox of the
positions.  The name prefix FIT refers to FITS-format extension table
lists, and TXT refers to lists in simple 80-column text.  Each of 
these four subdirectories contains 24 files covering one hour of right 
ascension apiece.  The file names specify the equinox and hour of right
ascension; e.g. B1950.00H or J2000.23H.  The machine-readable lists 
also give the sources' galactic latitudes and longitudes, 
fitted major axes, minor axes, and position angles, 
the local sky levels (baseline zero offsets of the Gaussian fits), 
and map pixel coordinates.

There is one source per line in the TXT-format lists.  The record 
format is illustrated by the first source in B1950.00H, 87GB 0000+1833:

The directory PROGS contains the FORTRAN programs SELECT.f and MATCH.f
that have been tested on a Convex C-1 (plus SELECT.FOR and MATCH.FOR 
tested on an IBM-compatible PC with DOS operating system).  The program
SELECT can be used to select sources from the source-list TXT files 
by right ascension range, declination range, absolute galactic latitude 
range, and flux density range; and then write the selected sources to 
an output file of the same format.  You may also find it useful as a 
"template" program that can be modified to perform other operations on 
the source list.  The program MATCH can be used to match objects with 
87GB sources by position coincidence.  Positions of the objects to be
matched with 87GB sources can be entered individually from a terminal 
or in a group from an external file.  Comment lines in the programs 
themselves provide additional details.

The FITS-format 87GB source-list files are dummy "images" with the
source lists in extension tables.  They can be read into AIPS with 
the task IMLOD just as maps can.  The extension tables can then be
viewed with the AIPS task PRTAB, and other AIPS tasks can operate
on the tables.
