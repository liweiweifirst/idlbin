TAPE MOUNTS
.Help

The official mechanism for requesting backup tapes and file
restoration is the invoke the REQUEST/TASK ORDER UTILITY:

$ SYSREQ

which will prompt for requested task completion date, description
(processing steps), copy of request, etc.  The CDAC NOTICE 
utility has a menu selection describing the procedure.  


9-Track Mag Tapes
-----------------

NOTE:  The following instructions are specifically for the VAX
cluster, for VAX readable 9-track magnetic tapes.  See FILE TRANSFER 
to move tape data to ULTRIX nodes.  GIs must ask support person 
for assistance.

Log in to VAX nodes SCINT, ALPHER, BETHE, or CSDR2.  Type

$ SHO DEV M

to show whether the tape drives $1$MUA0: and $1$MUA1: are
available.  If $1$MUA0: is on-line and not currently shown
as allocated (ALLOC), for example, issue the DCL command

$ ALLOCATE $1$MUA0:

Then hand your tape to an operator (interior office of Room 140)
and ask for the tape to be physically mounted on the specific
tape drive you just allocated.  When it is physically on the
tape drive, you must issue the software mount command, e.g.,

$ MOUNT/FOREIGN/DENSITY=6250/RECORDSIZE=2880/BLOCKSIZE=28800 $1$MUA0:

SET MAGTAPE commands are useful for positioning the tape to the
proper file, which can then be copied to disk with the following
DCL command:

$ COPY $1$MUA0: TAPEFILE.DAT

To software dismount the tape, without the tape being physically
dismounted so that it remains in a ready state without further
operator assistance, type

$ DISMOUNT/NOUNLOAD

When finished using the tape, issue the commands

$ REWIND $1$MUA0:
$ DISMOUNT $1$MUA0:
$ DEALLOCATE $1$MUA0:

and retrieve the tape from the operator.

4mm Tapes
---------

Many of the workstations have 4mm tape decks attached.  There is
a section describing their use in the COBE Guest Investigator
Handbook.
