YOUR LOGIN FILE
.Help

New users on either the VMS or ULTRIX nodes can obtain copies
of the Guest Investigator's suggested login file.  These
files can then be customized to suit each user's preferences.
Some samples for each platform are provided below.

On VMS Nodes
------------

A general LOGIN.COM file, located in the guest investigator's default
login directory, is provided to help guest users get started on the
CGIS system.  New CDAC users may copy an appropriate "starter"
LOGIN.COM file from CSDRDEV:[GIUSER]LOGIN.COM.  (Note: Guest
investigators may access a similar file from
CGIS_USER:[GIUSER]LOGIN.COM if they do not have a copy already in
their accounts.)

Users are encouraged to personalize their LOGIN.COM to suit their
personal preferences.  This file sets up some terminal settings.  It
also defines system logicals for printing, batch mail, and other
frequently used system commands.  Users may also specify a default
text editor from several supported on the CDAC systems.


EXAMPLES OF VMS CUSTOMIZING COMMANDS
------------------------------------

To set up a default editor (EDT is the system default), put a line 
like this in your LOGIN.COM file:

        $ EDIT :== EDIT/TPU

This sets up the VMS TPU editor as the default.  Other possibilities
are TECO, an interactive text editor, or EMACS, a full screen editor.
                

A sample print statement for your LOGIN.COM file is:

        $ PRINT :== PRINT/QUE=156_1590T/SETUP=(COURIER, PORTRAIT)/NOTIFY

This sends a file to the 1590T printer in Room 156 with Courier font
and portrait orientation.  The qualifier /NOTIFY produces a message 
across your screen that indicates when the job is complete.

On ULTRIX nodes
---------------

New users are welcome to copy both

  /cuba_b/cgis/users/giuser/.login
  /cuba_b/cgis/users/giuser/.cshrc

to their own default login directory on ULTRIX nodes.

Customizing recommendations are made in each of these files.
