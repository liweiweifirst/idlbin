CDAC WORKSTATIONS
.Help

The consoles for the CDAC VAXstations are located in Rooms 156
(Science Analysis Room), 140 (Data Operations Room) and 103 (DMR
Work Room).  Those allocated to the GI program, ZWICKY and CUBA,
are located in Room 119.  The Room 156 workstations are most 
available for the general user.  Note CUBA and HAITI are ULTRIX 
DECstations, while ALPHER, BETHE, GAMOW, DELTA, HERMNN, ZWICKY, 
ARUBA, BIKINI, TAHITI, TONGA, STBART and STKITT are VMS nodes.  
HAITI is also in Room 156.  Separate accounts are necessary 
to use the ULTRIX workstations.

Working at the workstation console requires familiarity with the
DECwindows system, which is outside the scope of this document; a
simple log-in procedure follows, and on-line help is available.
DECwindows documentation is available from the CDAC library.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here are a few general notes on using the mouse with the windows
for the inexperienced user:

o The default labels for the mouse buttons are 1 through 3 from
  left to right.

o Clicking means pushing down a mouse button (usually the left
  one) and releasing it (unless otherwise instructed).

o Double clicking means clicking twice in rapid succession.

o Dragging is accomplished by clicking and holding the mouse
  button down while moving the mouse pointer to the desired
  location.

o The menu line is the line in the window just below the title.
  Menu choices may be seen by clicking and holding the mouse button
  on the menu item.  To make a selection, drag the pointer down
  until a box appears around the desired selection, then release
  the button.  If none of the selections are to be chosen, simply
  moving the pointer out of the menu allows a safe exit.

o The right hand side of most windows features a scroll bar with
  an up arrow above and a down arrow below. These control what
  text is seen in the window.  To see previous items in a
  window, click on the fat part of the bar and drag it up a
  little.  Release the button and the text will update.  Clicking
  on the arrows also lets you move up and down in increments.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

The user enters user name and password followed by <CR> as usual.
After a little while, a window will appear on the screen labeled
"Session Manager."  There will probably be a message stating "Starting
DECterm" (VMS only).  If the message does not appear, a DECterm window
can be started by clicking on the Applications menu in the Session
Manager window and then selecting (clicking on) "DECterm".  It may
take a few minutes for the window to appear and once it does, it may
take a few more minutes before the system level prompt appears.

At this point in a session, the DECterm window behaves just like a
terminal.  When a session is complete, the standard VMS logout, LO
(logout for ULTRIX), will close and remove the DECterm window.
Choosing "Quit" from the Session menu of the Session Manager ends the
workstation session completely.

If other applications are desired, such as an alarm clock or
additional DECterm windows, they can be selected from the Applications
menu of the Session manager.  Other applications can be dismissed by
clicking in the upper left corner of the window border, and then on
Close.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A few further notes:

o An on-line help menu is found at the right end of nearly every
menu line, at the top of each window.

o The Automatic Startup... (ULTRIX: AutoStart...) item of the Options
(ULTRIX: Customize) menu allows the user to specify which applications
(e.g., DECterm) will be started automatically at the beginning of a
session.

o Type size for the DECterm session can be changed by selecting 
Options menu for the DECterm window, then Window.  Click on the 
desired Font, e.g. Big, then click on Apply and OK.  To save that
setting as your permanent default, click on the Options menu, and
on the Save Options entry.
