TERMINALS AT THE CDAC
.Help

Terminals at the CDAC are of three (VT240-compatible) types:
VT240, Micro-Term, and GraphOn.  All are useful for general
interactive work and have limited graphics capabilities which
depend on terminal type.  

The VT240 supports ReGIS graphics.  The Micro-Term supports ReGIS 
graphics, full Tektronix 4010 graphics, and a partial set of 
Tektronix 4014 graphics emulation features.  The GraphOn also 
supports ReGIS and a complete Tektronix 4014 emulation.  

All of the terminals at the CDAC are attached to the servers for
access to COBECL, as well as individual nodes in and out of the
cluster.  Some allow TELNET connection to several GSFC nodes including
STARS.

Many CDAC terminals have dot-matrix printers for printing text 
stream and some graphics.  See section on PRINTERS.

Note that Macintoshes and PCs can also be used in terminal emulation
to access CDAC nodes.  See MACINTOSHES and PC information (under
development).
