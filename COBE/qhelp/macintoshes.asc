MACINTOSHES AT THE CDAC
.Help

Three Macintosh II machines are currently on the CDAC Macintosh
network.  Two are resident in Room 156, and one is in an office (Room
118).  All are connected by Ethernet and Appletalk to a Laserwriter II
printer in Room 156.  A Macintosh Centris 650 and HPLaserjet 4M laser
printer for guest investigator use are located in Room 119.  This
printer may also be accessed from the Macintosh in Room 118.

Anthony Young (Room 112, 513-7744) has more information about the
VersaTerm-Pro package and the Macintoshes in general.


Logging in from the CDAC Mac network
------------------------------------

The CDAC Macintoshes reach the CDAC terminal server using the
VersaTerm-Pro package.  

* To reach this, double-click (push the mouse button twice in quick
  succession) with the screen arrow pointing to the Hard Disk icon.

* Double-click again on the Communications folder.  

* Double-click again on the VersaTerm-PRO folder.  

* Finally, double-click on the VersaTerm PRO icon to activate the
  program.  

This will produce two windows, one in front of the other.  The front
one is labeled "VersaTerm-PRO DEC VT100 `DEC VAX'" and is used for
text editing and commands; the back one is "VersaTerm-PRO Tek 4014
`DEC VAX'" and emulates a graphics terminal.  (The user can bring a
back window forward just by clicking on a part of the desired window.)

* Once these windows are up, hitting the <CR> key with the VT100
  window in front gives a Server> prompt.  You may then log into the
  COBE computers as you would from any other terminal.

To end a session, log off of the computer in the usual way, then
choose "Quit" from the File menu at the top of the Macintosh
screen.  All of the open windows may be closed in turn by
clicking once in the small box in the upper left corner of
each window.

With VersaTerm-Pro running, there are four printing options that
appear under the File menu at the top of the screen: Print
Stream, Print Graphics, Print Selection, and Page Setup.  All
outputs will be routed to the Laserwriter II in Room 156.

PRINT STREAM:  Will print everything that appears on the screen
after it is activated (by choosing it in the menu) until it is
turned off.  A check-mark will appear to the left of the entry
as long as it is activated.  Printing will not begin until the option
is deactivated.

PRINT GRAPHICS:  Will print a snapshot of the graphics screen.

PRINT SELECTION: Will print the selected text.  Text is selected by
moving the screen arrow or I-bar to the beginning of the desired text
by moving the mouse on the pad.  Press the mouse button and hold it
down while you move the mouse until the cursor is at the end of the
desired text.  (The text should be highlighted.)  Release the mouse
button at the end of the selection.

PAGE SETUP: Allows user to change the number of characters per line,
printer format, Tektronix hardcopy request, graphics print type, and
printer type.


Logging in from the GI Mac
--------------------------

The GI Macintosh connects to other computers using the MacX package.
Currently it only connects to CUBA; this is illustrated in the
directions below.  Documentation for MacX is available in Room 119.

* To begin, double click on the MacX icon.  The program is ready to run
  when the MacX title box disappears from the center of the screen and
  the top pulldown menu choices have changed.  One of these new choices
  is "Remote."  

* Under the Remote menu, choose New Command....  This brings up a
  panel labeled New Remote Command.

* First fill in the Remote Command box.  (The line will automatically
  wrap if necessary.)  For CUBA, the command is

/usr/bin/X11/xterm -ls -title "option-Rcuba xterm" -sb -display
"option-Rdisplay"<TAB>

   Note: option-R above means to press one of the option keys and the
   letter r simultaneously.  It will appear on the screen as an R
   surrounded by a circle.  

* The <TAB> puts you in the Username field.  Enter your username on
  the remote node, CUBA in this case, followed by a <TAB>.

* Now enter your remote password in the Password field.

* Click in the Host... box.  Fill in the Host Name or Address (CUBA =
  192.94.237.18) OR pick the desired node from the host list.  Click
  OK.

* Now back in the New Remote Command box, click on Execute.  The xterm
  window should appear.
