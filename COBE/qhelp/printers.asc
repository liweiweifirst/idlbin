CDAC PRINTERS
.Help

The Cosmology Data Analysis Center (CDAC) supports three types 
of printers for users: dot-matrix printers, laser printers, 
and high-speed line printers.  

Dot-matrix (e.g., DEC LA50 and LA70 printers) are attached to 
many CDAC terminals and are convenient for low-volume,low-quality 
output.  They can be used to print the current text display (using 
the PRINT SCREEN button in the top left row of the keyboard), the 
graphics display (SHIFT-PRINT SCREEN), or continuously print the 
text being displayed on the screen (^-PRINT SCREEN) until 
turned off by the next ^-PRINT SCREEN.

Laser printers are located as follows:

Room      Printer               Mnemonic    Capabilities
----      -------               --------    ------------
103       Talaris 800            800        text, QMS ***SLOW***
          HPLaserJet IIISi       hplaser    PS and text

140       Talaris 800            800        text, QMS ***SLOW***
          Talaris 1590T          1590t      text, Qic, PS, TEK
          HPLaserJet IIISi       hplaser    PS and text

156       Talaris 1590LN         1590ln     text only
          Talaris 1590T          1590t      text, Qic, PS, TEK
          HPLaserJet IIISi       hplaser    PS and text
          Seiko ColorPoint       seiko      PS only 
          Tektronix Phaser IISD  tek2sd     PS only

The queue names are defined by room number and printer mnemonic, 
e.g., 156_1590T.  

The Talaris 800 is a slow printer and not recommended for general use. 

The 1590LN printer in Room 156 is useful for text output only; to 
print a file on this printer with normal (i.e., portrait) orientation

from VMS                             from ULTRIX  
--------                             -----------
$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_1590LN filename    % lpr -P156_1590ln filename

The 1590T printers are useful for both text and graphics file output.
(The default is landscape.)  To print a text file in Roman font, 6
lines per inch at 12 pitch, portrait mode, use (for the Room 156
printer)

from VMS                             
--------
$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_1590T/FORM=ER612P filename

and similarly for the 1590T in Room 140.  Type NOTICE at the system
prompt for information on other VMS formats or setups.  (Choose
"Printer Information SUBMENU," then "QMS Setup information.")  ULTRIX
users can specify only the queue name and must use the printer
defaults.  If special formatting is desired, ULTRIX users may convert
their ASCII files to PostScript using the a2ps program.  (See the
ULTRIX on-line help for a2ps by typing man a2ps.)  The 1590T printers
can accept graphics files in PostScript, Quick and Tektronix formats.
The respective VMS commands are:

$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_1590T/FORM=DEFAULT/SETUP=PSI filename (PostScript)
$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_1590T/FORM=DEFAULT/SETUP=QC filename (Quick)
$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_1590T/FORM=DEFAULT/PASSALL filename (TEK)

The HPLaserJet printers can print text or PostScript files.  To print
PostScript files on these printers use 

from VMS                             from ULTRIX
--------                             -----------
$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_HPLASER filename   % lpr -P156_hplaser filename

To print text files on the HPLaserJets from VMS see setup information
in $ NOTICE under printers, HPLaser.

The Seiko color printer uses wax transfer technology and has a 
resolution of 300 x 300.  This is the less expensive of the color
printers and is recommended for general use when color is desired but
publication quality is not required.

from VMS                             from ULTRIX
--------                             -----------
$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_SEIKO filename     % lpr -P156_seiko filename

The Tektronix color printer is more expensive; it also prints ONLY
PostScript files.

from VMS                             from ULTRIX
--------                             -----------
$ PRINT/QUEUE=156_TEK2SD filename    % lpr -P156_tek2sd filename

High-speed line printers are available to the clustered VMS machines
for large-volume text output up to 132 characters per line.  There are
three printers in Room 140, with queue names DIRBE_LCA0, DMR_LCA0, and
FIRAS_LCA0; only DMR_LCA0, however, is in the publicly accessible
area.  No forms or setups are required, so the command is simply (for
example):

from VMS
--------
$ PRINT/QUEUE=DIRBE_LCA0 filename

A list of print queue names and useful forms is maintained on VMS in
the PRINTERS option of NOTICE.  The ULTRIX printer names can be found
in the file /etc/printcap.

To find your print job(s) in the queues, for a job issued to queue
156_1590t, for example

from VMS                              from ULTRIX
--------                              -----------
$ SHOW QUEUE *156_1590T*              % lpq *156_1590t* 

The response from these commands will show you the specific queue
controlling the printing, and a job number.  To remove a job from 
a print queue

from VMS                              from ULTRIX
--------                              -----------
$ DELETE /ENTRY=### queuename         % lprm ###
where ### is the job number           where ### is the job number
and queuename is the full             shown by the lpq command
name in the response to the
SHOW QUEUE

                           {R} End of text. {N}
