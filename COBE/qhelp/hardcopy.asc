HOW TO GET A DOCUMENT
.Help
If you would like a printed copy of a CGIS document by U. S. Mail,
place request by e-mail or phone:

     COBECL::RAWLEY (SPAN) or
     rawley@aruba.gsfc.nasa.gov (Internet), or 
     phone (301) 513-7764.

Please include your name, mailing address (and phone) in your message.

Documents may also be copied electronically.  The guest user documents
directories are
      
     on ZWICKY (VMS):                      on CUBA (ULTRIX):

     CSDRDEV:[CGIS.USERDOC]             /cuba_b/cgis/source/userdoc

Document filenames on both systems begin with these mnemonics:

     GIHB  = Guest Investigator Handbook 
     USER  = CGIS User's Guide  
     (cookbook, when available)
     (explanatory supplements, when available)
     CSC   = COBE Software Catalog
     PIP   = Proposer Information Package
     CDAC  = CDAC Orientation Handbook 


For each document there are three versions with file extensions 
that indicate the file format:

     ASC = ASCII 
     PS  = PostScript 
     WP  = WordPerfect (version 5.1)

Print versions (PS, WP) of very long documents may be broken into 
chapter/sections for ease of transmission.  These have two digits 
appended onto the document mnemonic to indicate the document 
chapter at the beginning of the particular file, or X and the 
letter for an appendix, or IN for index and TI for title page, 
table of contents.

For example the ASCII version of the Proposer Information Package
has filename pip.asc (lowercase required on ULTRIX); the first 
chapter of the PostScript CGIS User's Guide has filename user10.ps.

Contact Gayle Rawley at the above addresses if you encounter any
problems transferring these document files electronically.

publications are available in a subdirectory of the documents
