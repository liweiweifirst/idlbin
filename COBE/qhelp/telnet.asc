ACCESSING CDAC NODES USING TELNET
.Help

TELNET allows users to connect their terminals to other hosts on 
a network as though the terminals were hardwired to those hosts.  
The simplest way to run TELNET is to invoke TELNET with the host 
name at the DCL or UNIX prompt.  For example,

$ TELNET ARUBA.GSFC.NASA.GOV   or      % telnet cuba.gsfc.nasa.gov

will connect the user to the           will connect the user to the
aruba node of the CDAC cluster         the GI ULTRIX node cuba from
from a VMS machine.                    a UNIX machine.

TELNET allows access to VMS nodes from UNIX machines and the reverse.

There is no TELNET address for the cluster.  Specific nodes may be 
reached not only by name, but by using the specific node number:

name       number      |  name       number
----       ------      |  ----       ------
alpher  192.94.237.7   |  bethe   192.94.237.8
delta   192.94.237.9   |  hermnn  192.94.237.10
zwicky  192.94.237.11  |  gamow   192.94.237.12
aruba   192.94.237.13  |  bikini  192.94.237.14
tahiti  192.94.237.16  |  tonga   192.94.237.17
cuba    192.94.237.18  |  haiti   192.94.237.19
stkitt  192.94.237.20  |  stbart  192.94.237.21

For example, the aruba node may also be reached with the command 

$ TELNET 192.94.237.13

(Note that the cuba and haiti nodes are ULTRIX machines, for which
special accounts are needed; that delta, stbart and stkitt are often
reserved for specific instrument team work; and that cuba and 
zwicky may be reserved for use by GIs.)

Some of the CDAC's terminals allow TELNET connections from the 
server prompt to CDAC nodes and some GSFC nodes, e.g.

SERVER> telnet stars

where no extension is necessary for local (CDAC and GSFC) nodes.

A TELNET session is terminated automatically when the user logs
off of the remote site.

Help with choosing a command inside TELNET may be obtained by
typing a question mark (no <CR> in VMS) at the TELNET> prompt.
