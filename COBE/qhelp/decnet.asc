ACCESSING THE CDAC COMPUTERS FROM REMOTE SESSION
.Help

From Remote VAX/VMS Session
---------------------------

The CDAC nodes may be accessed remotely from a remote VAX/VMS 
session using the SET HOST command:

$ SET HOST node

where node must be a recognized node name or integer DECNET
address.  To access the CDAC cluster, where the system will route 
the user to an available node, type

$ SET HOST COBECL

or

$ SET HOST 7210

The host machine's normal login prompts will appear when the 
connection is made.  DECNET connection can be made to ULTRIX
nodes in the same manner.

Access to a specific node is obtained by using the specific node
name or number:

name   number  !  name   number
----   ------  !  ----   ------
alpher  6846   !  bethe   6847
delta   6955   !  hermnn  6848
zwicky  6959   !  gamow   6468
aruba   6387   !  bikini  6390
tahiti  6386   !  tonga   6389
cuba    6948   !  haiti   6949
stkitt  6926   !  stbart  6825


Note that the cuba and haiti nodes are ULTRIX machines; users
must have special accounts to access these workstations.  Note
also that delta, stkitt, and stbart may be restricted to
instrument team use, and that zwicky and cuba may be reserved 
for GI use.

From Remote UNIX Session
------------------------

Both ULTRIX and VMS CDAC nodes can be accessed from remote UNIX 
sessions with the rlogin command:

% rlogin zwicky

where the argument must be a recognized node name, or Internet
node name, as in:

% rlogin stars.gsfc.nasa.gov

To accomplish a login to your remote account under a different 
user name than on the current ULTRIX account, use:

% rlogin bikini -l username

where username is the correct username on node bikini.  You will
be prompted for your password.  More information and options
are available by typing 

% man rlogin

from an ULTRIX node.  Note the node restrictions specified at 
the end of the VMS information above.
