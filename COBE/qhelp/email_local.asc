ELECTRONIC MAIL
.Help

The most common form of communication between Cosmology Data Analysis
Center (CDAC) users is via electronic mail (EMAIL).

EMAIL on VMS nodes
------------------
The VAXMAIL electronic mail facility is described in the VAX/VMS Primer.  
(Copies are available in the CDAC library.)  Local CDAC addresses are 
found in the complete list of CDAC users, which also includes room and 
phone numbers, in CSDR$BULLETIN:[MAIL]CDAC.DIS.

To send mail, type

$ MAIL

and then at the mail prompt, type

MAIL>  SEND

You will be prompted for the address (TO:) and the subject.  After
entering the text of the message, type ^Z to send it.  
There is on-line help for MAIL, from the system and within
MAIL by typing ? at the prompt.  It is possible to define
MAIL in your LOGIN.COM so that it will automatically put
you into your default editor to type the body of the message.

VAXMAIL is also used to communicate with users at the Goddard Space
Flight Center (GSFC) VAX clusters, or at any facility with Space
Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) access.  The protocol for the
addressee is the same in either case: node_name::userid. 

Please note:  In some instances the destination cluster may not
be recognized by the local COBECL VAX node, especially if it is
located other than at GSFC.  In such instances, a simple
workaround is to use the STARS VAX at GSFC as an intermediate
node, i.e., use the protocol STARS::node_name::userid instead.
This will also work for incoming mail; if the outside cluster
does not recognize COBECL, try STARS::COBECL:: userid instead.

An alternate workaround is to use the equivalent COBECL cluster number
7120 (7120::userid).  A table of the integer DECNET addresses for
individual machines on the COBECL cluster is found on the "Decnet,
rlogin" screen under the Remote Access Information menu of the COBE
Guest Investigator Support (CGIS) Software Executive.

VAXMAIL can also be used to send electronic mail from the COBECL
cluster or the STARS machine to users on Internet or Arpanet.
The protocol is simply

SMTP%" user_id@internet_or_arpanet_address "

For example, if the network address is SMITH@ABC.DEF.GHI, the
VAXMAIL is addressed to SMTP%"SMITH@ABC.DEF.GHI".  Please note:
Incoming Internet mail must not be addressed to
COBECL.GSFC.NASA.GOV as this is not a valid address and the
message will be lost.  Mail may be safely sent to individual
nodes (e.g., MATHER@BIKINI.GSFC.NASA.GOV).

Finally, VAXMAIL can be used to send mail to users on GSFCMAIL,
NASAMAIL and telemail.  The protocol is similar to that above,
with the address specified as AMES::" user_id@mail_type", e.g.,
AMES::"SMITH@GSFCMAIL".

A useful variation of VAXMAIL is the BMAIL command.  This is a batch
mail facility which will periodically attempt to send mail to the
addressee(s) over several hours.  It is useful if the status of the
destination computer is unknown.  You may enter the message directly
from the keyboard, or put it in a file.  If the latter, the user then
simply enters BMAIL file_name at the DCL prompt, and is then prompted
for addressees, subject, and CCs. BMAIL will send a VAXMAIL message to
the sender when it has either: 1) succeeded in sending mail to all
addressees or 2) failed to send to one or more addressees after a
fixed number of attempts.


email on ULTRIX nodes
---------------------

On CDAC ULTRIX machines, email is routed through Internet directly.  
To send mail to user smith at Internet node ABC.DEF.GHI, type

% mail smith.abc.def.ghi

you will be prompted for the subject, and can then type in your 
message followed by ^d to end the message. At that point you 
will be prompted for carbon copy addresses.  Since DECNET is 
installed on the CDAC ULTRIX nodes SPAN addresses as defined above
can also be used, e.g.

% mail stars::mather

More about the ULTRIX mail facility is available by typing

% man mail

A summary of useful mail commands appears when mail is invoked 
and a ? is typed at the mail prompt.
